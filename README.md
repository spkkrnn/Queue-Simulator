# Queue Simulator for AoI

A simple queue simulator on the basis of [queuing theory](https://www.britannica.com/science/queuing-theory) that calculates the average Age of Information<sup>1</sup> (AoI). It provides the queue disciplines FIFO and PS for a single queue. Customers' arrival and service times are generated from the exponential distribution based on the arrival or service rate respectively.
